# Villain component boundaries

Villain owns compositor and window-manager behavior:

- Wayland compositor operation and surface lifecycle;
- layout, workspaces, focus, and window management;
- input policy and compositor-side interaction; and
- the private compositor protocol used by Knave components.

Knave owns session lifecycle, user-facing settings, the public desktop API, and
shell/UI presentation. Villain must consume explicit projections or protocol
messages rather than reading Knave's private state or writing the user's
canonical configuration.

Changes involving focus, input, surface commits, layer-shell, XWayland, VT
selection, or process shutdown must be reviewed as behavior changes, not only
as local refactors.
