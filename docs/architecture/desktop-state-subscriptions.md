# Desktop state subscriptions

Villain implements Knave desktop API 1.2 `subscribe` on a dedicated connection.
The first response is a complete snapshot, registered atomically on the compositor
event loop. Later snapshots replace prior state and may coalesce intermediate
changes. Existing request/response clients are unaffected; no unsolicited frames
are written to query or action connections.

Relevant mutations mark desktop metadata dirty. After an event batch, Villain
compares workspace/window summaries and advances a session-local generation only
when they differ. Wayland title/app-ID callbacks and XWayland property notifications
are included. Cursor movement and pixel-only commits do not broadcast snapshots.
This does not implement live preview damage notifications.

A nonblocking listener accepts up to 16 clients. Each client uses one worker;
subscription workers block on socket readiness and a wake socket instead of a
timer. Each subscriber retains at most one pending frame; serialized frames
are shared and transmitted at no more than 16 MiB. Serialization may allocate
more transiently before checking the size. Queued requests are cancelled after
two seconds; requests already executing wait for their actual result. Socket
writes time out after two seconds. Per-client socket setup failures close only
that client. Completion notifications reap workers and close control descriptors;
shutdown removes sources, closes all client sockets and joins workers. The
compositor never waits for subscriber writes.

Deploy the pinned Knave API revision, then this compositor, then the subscribing
shell. API 1.0/1.1 query/action clients retain support. Roll back the shell before
the server. No user configuration, socket path or permissions change occurs.
See Knave's ADR 0002 for wire semantics and compatibility. Binary version stays
unreleased 0.1.0; the public desktop API advances from 1.1 to 1.2.

## Measurement

After `cargo build --release --locked`, run
`python3 scripts/measure-desktop-subscriptions.py` on a Wayland desktop. The
script starts separate, isolated nested compositors and compares a client
querying every 500 ms with an idle subscription on the same new server binary.
This is a protocol-equivalent polling baseline, not a run of the old server.

One run on 2026-09-28 observed:

| Mode | Periodic queries / 5 s | CPU ticks | RSS KiB start/end | Threads | FDs | Context-switch delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Polling baseline | 10 | +3 | 101624/101676 | 8 | 35 | +96 |
| Idle subscription | 0 | +2 | 105184/105208 | 8 | 37 | +27 |
| 40 workspace changes and 40 subscriber reconnects | 0 | +1 | 104896/105252 | 8 | 37 | +203 |

The stress run returned to 8 threads and 37 descriptors. Action
acknowledgement to snapshot receipt was 0.153 ms median, 0.421 ms p95 and
0.670 ms maximum, with increasing generations. The five-second idle
subscription had no unsolicited data. These are single-run observations,
not a stable CPU or memory improvement claim. Whole-process context switches
are a wakeup proxy and include nested rendering; exact IPC wakeups, direct-TTY
behavior, old-server resource measurements, and long-running stress results
remain unknown. The expected deterministic change is removal of two periodic
snapshot requests per second while connected.
